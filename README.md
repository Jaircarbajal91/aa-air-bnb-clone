# Welcome to Jair BnB!

### This website is a pixel-perfect clone of Air BnB's website. I tweaked the title of the clone I create because my name is Jair (obviously)!

### Every spot listing that is available on this site is themed on Jair's passions/favorite things. You'll have the option to stay in a gaming house, cat cottage, dog house, and many other of Jair's favorite themed spots!
